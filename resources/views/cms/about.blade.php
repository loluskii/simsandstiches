            <h5>About us</h5>

            <p>Simss & Stitches was founded in Norwich, UK, 2015. At the time Simisola Oladinni, our founder, was in
                the university studying pharmacy, when the idea struck her. Her mission was to showcase vibrant African
                print and designs to a city in the UK were diversity was low, the walls were grey and the weather was
                gloomy. Simss & stitches is a joint venture between Simi and her mom, Bimbo Oladinni, who majored in
                fine art.</p>

            <h5>Vision </h5>
            <p>To make African culture globally accessible through print and design</p>

            <h5>Mission</h5>

            <p>To promote and celebrate the rich cultural heritage of African fashion by creating and showcasing
                exquisite, elegant, and contemporary designs that merge traditional African elements with modern
                aesthetics. Our mission is to redefine and elevate the perception of African fashion both locally and
                globally, making it a symbol of elegance, sophistication, and style. We aim to empower local artisans
                and promote sustainable practices by sourcing materials and manufacturing locally. Through our brand, we
                strive to inspire diversity in culture, inclusivity, and pride in African fashion and contribute to the
                economic growth of the African fashion industry.</p>

            <h5>Sustainable fashion</h5>

            <p>Simss & Stitches is a sustainable fashion brand hence we produce and encourage styling that benefit the
                environment and minimize the negative impact of the fashion industry on our planet. Our 3 pillars of
                sustainability include:</p>

            <h5>Ethical sourcing</h5>
            <p> We source our fabrics locally in Nigeria, ensuring fair trade and consciously using fabrics that are
                made here from scratch or printed locally.</p>

            <h5>Eco friendly material</h5>
            <p>We mostly opt for materials that have a lower environmental impact, such as organic cotton, linen, or
                wool. These materials require fewer resources and chemicals to produce and are biodegradable or
                recyclable</p>

            <h5>Low-waste production</h5>
            <p>We focus on reducing waste throughout the production process. This includes minimizing fabric waste,
                using efficient cutting techniques, incorporating scrap materials into our designs and using the slow
                fashion approach rather than the fast fashion model in production.</p>
